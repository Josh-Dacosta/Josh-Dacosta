**`Aspiring Data Scientist (Data Science | ML & Automation | Automotive Systems)`**

<p>
	I'm a Master's student in Data Science with a strong foundation in Python-based development, analytics, machine learning, and automation. I have an ever growing focus on applying data-driven solutions to real-world operational and manufacturing problems. My background includes hands-on experience with computer vision, NLP pipelines, inventory-focused automation, where I have build end-to-end systems that emphasize reproducibility, scalability, an detailed communication.
	Outside of coursework and projects, I enjoy automotive technology, restoration, and hands-on problem solving, which continues to shape my interest in manufacturing analytics, systems engineering, and data science applications in industry.

	<summary><h3>My Journey</h3></summary>
	My path into data science began with a curiosity for computer science and how systems work—both in software and the physical world. I started tinkering with RC and scale model toys growing up, developing a fascination for how things function. From there I moved onto cars and handiwork by helping my dad. As I progressed, I developed strong analytical thinking and problem solving skills that led me to work on my own. With this newfound technical understanding, I could do everything from minor mechanical maintenance like brakes and oil changes to more advanced repairs like complete engine replacement. The same goes for house endevors as well, from replacing electrical outlets to building furniture, my hunger for learning to do things was always strong. Academically, this led me to choose between Engineering or Computer Science—I chose the latter. Through classes, I developed a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and team collaboration. I became increasingly interested in how data could be used not just to describe systems, but to optimize, automate, and improve them. Through my internship at Georgia Tech, I developed an automation tool for IT offices that optimize the process of developing quotes for new computing equipment and inventory needs.
